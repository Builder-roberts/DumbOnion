# Setting up your project
1. Install Atom and the TTS plugin: http://berserk-games.com/knowledgebase/atom-editor-plugin/
2. In Atom, go to File->Settings->Packages->Click on settings for tabletopsimulator-lua
3. Check "#include other files"
4. Under "Base path for files you wish to #include", paste the path to your git folder
5. Now load your save of DumbOnion and optionally make a new save file if you wish to keep a clean copy.
6. Now right-click your Project explorer on the left side and choose "Add project folder" and choose your git folder.
7. You should now be able to edit the code as separate files, rather than one big global file. Select Packages->Tabletop Simulator->Save and Play to update and load your save file with script changes.
